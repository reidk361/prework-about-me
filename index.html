      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm 24yrs old, married, and recently got out of the Navy. I have some experience with HTML (and a little CSS), but otherwise no coding experience.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Most recently, Washington, but I grew up in the Bible Belt area.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy drawing and making fractal art. I also play a lot of video games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't have lofty career goals. I would like a job that pays well, has a decent work/life balance, and doesn't aggrivate my injury (see "Why do you want to be a web developer?")</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently live in Oregon, a little outside Portland.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I got a chronic ankle injury that prevents me from doing jobs that involve extensive standing and walking. I would also prefer a work-from-home position that pays decently.</p>
